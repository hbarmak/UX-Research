# UX-Research Portfolio

Welcome to my research portfolio! This repository showcases my work in User Experience Research, Interfacde Design and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Happy Exploring!

Below are some of the key research projects I have worked on:

1. **[Infinity Loop]**  
   Description: Infinity Loop is a social networking website with the goal of connecting the user to 100+ friends. The features, user research and heuristics evaluation are also included.

2. **[Pregnancy Mobile Application]**  
   Description: This idea of creating a mobile application for expecting moms emerged when an [expecting-]mom could not find a timely support for her concerns. The report and interface designs are included.



I am continuously updating this portfolio with new research findings, projects, and collaborations.
